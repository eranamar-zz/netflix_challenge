#Simplified Netflix Challenge (research project)

This was the final project in Statistical Machine Learning course at HUJI (winter 2016/17).

Authors: Eran Amar & Tomer Levy.

Keywords: Machine learning, KNN, random forests, elastic nets.

In this project we attempted to tackle a simplified version of the 2009 Netflix Challenge. We reviewed various Machine Learning techniques to create the best model possible for predicting user ranks. We began with exploring the standard models individually, starting from k-nearest neighbors, random forests and	then Elastic nets. For each, we tried to build a non-trivial enhancement to the model. Later, we composed those models in order to create stronger predictor.
